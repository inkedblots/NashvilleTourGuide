    <!-- General Info About Nashville (from wiki page)-->
    <string name="infoGeography">Geography.
                                \nNashville is the capital of Tennessee.
                                \nFounded	1779
                                \nIncorporated	1806</string>

    <!--  Taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee -->
    <string name="aboutNashville">The town of Nashville was founded by James Robertson, John Donelson,
        and a party of Overmountain Men in 1779, near the original Cumberland settlement of Fort Nashborough.
        It was named for Francis Nash, the American Revolutionary War hero. Nashville quickly grew
        because of its strategic location, accessibility as a port on the Cumberland River, a
        tributary of the Ohio River; and its later status as a major railroad center.
        \nBy 1800, the city had 345 residents, including 136 enslaved African Americans and 14 free
        African American residents. In 1806, Nashville was incorporated as a city and became the county
        seat of Davidson County, Tennessee. In 1843, the city was named the permanent capital of
        the state of Tennessee.\n</string>
